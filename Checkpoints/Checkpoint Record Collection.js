/* Checkpoint: Record Collection

You are given a JSON object representing (a small part of) your record collection. Each album is identified by a unique id number and has several properties. Not all albums have complete information.

Write a function which takes an id, a property (prop), and a value.

For the given id in collection:

If value is non-blank (value !== "") and prop is not "tracks" then update or set the value for the prop.

If the prop is "tracks" and value is non-blank, push the value onto the end of the tracks array.

If value is blank, delete that prop.

Always return the entire collection object.

Note
Don't forget to use bracket notation when accessing object properties with variables.
